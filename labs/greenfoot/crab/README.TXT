Welcome to CRAB WORLD.  This is a simple Greenfoot scenario, designed 
for learning the basics of programming. 

In this world, crabs walk along a beach. Everything else is up to you.

This scenario is designed to be used with "The Greenfoot Book", which 
tells you how to approach programming this scenario.
