Give examples of the following from the Crab game:
Class=crab
Attribute=numEaten=state of object

Method:
act() {
	methodName()
	turn()
	move()
	canSee()
}

crab class inherits from animal class (inheritance)
overriding. if you have a method in a class (which already exists in the inherited class) the child method will over ride the parent method.

objects dont control the other objects

add(1,2)

add(1a,1b,2a,2b)

encapsulation=1 object is in control of its own domain

Primitive Data and Objects:
	- Simple (primitive) data types
		int: 4 bytes signed -2147483648 to 2147483648
		boolean: compiler dependant
		double: (-1)^sign(1.abc...z)2 x 2^e-1023
			where there are 52 bits for the fraction (mantissa), 11 bits for the exponent, and 1 bit for the sign -1.7E+308 to 1.7E+308 with almost 16 significant digits
		char: 2 bytes, 65,535 unicode characters
	- Overflow vs Underflow
	   1   1   1
		1 	1 	1 	1
		+ 			1

	- Variable vs Constant(final)
	- What is literal and string literal?
		How are chars and Strings concatenated?
		What is the difference between print and println?
