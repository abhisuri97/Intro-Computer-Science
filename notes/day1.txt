Computer Hardware components:
power supply
microprocessor
expansion slot
expansion card
chipset (help transfer info back and forth)
disk drives (store information)
cables that transfer data from ext. storage to motherboard
motherboard
-when working with electronics, make sure to ground yourself.

Digital Computers:
- analog signal
- analog hardware is less flexible and less accurate b/c it is more likely to be affected by noise
- A digital signal is achieved by setting a threshold to create two states. The info is more robust than that of analog signals
- A sampling rate must be chosen for digital signals. How does one choose an appropriate rate?
- How is the information stored in a digital system?

E.g.

Transistors set a threshold for information (1 or 0)
Sampling rate > 2 times the highest frequency. Greater sampling rate = more data. Useful in music. digital signals are extended over a delta time to make music sound continuous. 
Digital imaging sampling. Low sampling rate leads to pixelation. 

Binary Base system. 
All letters are encoded into decimals.
