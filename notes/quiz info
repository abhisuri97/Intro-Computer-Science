Obj1 == Obj2 (are the objects are the same address? if they are they are called ALIASES)
Ob1 = Obj2 (this is called an ASSIGNMENT. you make them equal. Left hand side gets its value set by the value of Object 2. They are now aliases)

if (condition1 && condition2)
when condition1 is false, the if statement doesn't pass


parameter passing: method (primdata type, Sting, obj)
for primative data types, you are passing in actual value.
e.g. 
int num = 2
methodname(int num)
num is 2

Strings are immutable (local variable)

Case:
Android1
	memory = 10
if you put android1 into a method which increments memory by 1, it not only changes memory within the method but ALSO changes the memory variable for all instances of it.


example interfaces

Class
{
	private int score = 0;
		public int updateScore(int num)
		{
			score += num;
			return score;
		}

}

Interface:
public int interfaceMethod(ClassMine class1);
