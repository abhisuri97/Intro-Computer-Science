A java interface is similar to a class but may only include FINAL FIELDS (CONSTANTS) and ABSTRACT METHODS
Abstract methods
	- Do not have implementations
	- A header followed by a semicolon with no body
	- An interface can NOT be instantiated
Useful when a characteristic is used for many different objects
Also useful when adding or changing objects frequently
Comparable interface
	- compareTo is its only method
	- int compareTo(String str) for String objects
	- int compareTo(int myInt) for Integer objects
List Interface
	- 4 interface methods
		- size
		- add
		- iterator
		- list iterator
