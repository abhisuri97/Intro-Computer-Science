Self Review:
7.5: super reference can call the parent constructor b/c it cannot be invoked by using its name. It can invoke the parent's version of an overridden method.
7.6: All classes in java are derived from the Object class therefore all public methods are available to every object
7.7: Abstract class represents a general idea. Common characteristics and method signatures can be defined in it. The child class inherits these traits.
7.8: If a class member is private it is not usable (the child class cannot reference it by name). But it can be referenced indirectly in the child class.
