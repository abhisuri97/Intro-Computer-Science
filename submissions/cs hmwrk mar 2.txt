Self Review Ch 7:
1. Child class comes from parent class via inheritence since the child inherits the methods and vars of the parent class based on the modifier declarations.
2. Since the new class can be derived from the existing class, there is no need to copy and change the code since the characteristics of the parent are inherited
3. inheritence should represent an "is-a" relationship so the child is-a version of the parent
4. Child classes can override the definition of a method by the parent class by making its own definition.
