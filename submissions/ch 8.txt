Self-Review- 
8.1: In recursion a method calls itself, solving a smaller version of the problem each time until you reach the base case.
8.2: Infinite recursion happens when no base case exists and will eventually take up all memory (causing an error)
8.3: You need to have a base case to avoid an infinite recursion which takes up more memory
8.4: Recursion is not necessary and can be solved through an iterative manner (recursion is a more elegant way of approaching the problem)
8.5: Use an iterative solution when appropriate (when it is simpler to use iteration ove recursion)
8.6: Indirect recursion- happens when a method calls another method (and continues calling another method) until the final method calls the original method. This is harder to follow.
